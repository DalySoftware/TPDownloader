# TPDownloader
An open source alternative Trading Paints downloader for IRacing.

## Installation
TBC

## Usage
TBC

## Features
- Downloads, unpacks and saves all paint types
- Cleans up anything it downloaded when stopped or session exited
- ðŸš§ Currently doesn't trigger IRacing to refresh paints after finishing downloads
  - You can do this via a keybind (default Ctrl + R)
  - I plan to find a way to do this automatically

No other major features are planned. The intention is to keep this minimalist downloader so that you can reasonably review the program before running on your system.
